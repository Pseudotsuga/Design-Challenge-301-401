        <h2>Why Travelling Was Uncomfortable In The Past</h2>

        <p>Even though travel was highly prevalent back in the day, it was neither easy nor comfortable to travel. There were limited means of transportation, and people did not know how to prepare for this activity.
        </p>

        <p>It resulted in people getting ill, and in some cases, they even died. You have to <strong>ready yourself</strong> for the harshest and most extreme of conditions as you never know when the weather might change. The first mistake people made was that they did not know what kind of garments they should be carrying along with themselves while traveling. 
        </p>
        <p>They usually took the same clothes they wore back at home, not knowing that the weather in the other country might be extremely hot or cold. This lack of knowledge was also because there wasn't a lot of readily available information back in the day and people had to rely on word of mouth to get any knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>As time went by, awareness increased and especially with the availability of the internet, all kinds of authentic information is available at a person's fingertips. Now, people know what garments they should be carrying with them, although some people could still make better choices.
        </p>
        <p>Some garments are infinitely better than the others when it comes to protecting a person from the harmful elements the weather brings along. For example, wearing a sweater is quintessential for the winter season as it will keep you warm and make sure that your skin doesn't suffer significant damage.
        </p>
        <p>Oppositely, wearing a sweater in summers, you will put yourself at the risk of exhaustion and profuse sweating; wearing a light material shirt would be a better choice for summers.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/Sweater-In-Summer-300x300.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Similarly, if you live at a place where it rains continuously, it would be a wise choice to keep a couple of raincoats at your disposal, as they not only protect your clothing, but they also protect you from other harmful elements of the rain.
        </p>
        <p>Travelers of this day and age are savvy enough to know most of these things, and nearly all of them pack accordingly. As we briefly mentioned earlier, travel was not easy back in the day, and people had to go through numerous hurdles to reach their destinations and come back. 
        </p>
        <p>Means of communication, transport, and essential safety items that we have in this day and age were not available back in the day, making the lives of travelers twice as hard.
        </p>
        <p>It would be safe to say that most of the travelers in the old age were purely depending on their luck to reach their destination without any significant problem. You will be surprised to find out that pre-historic traveling has also been the source of a few plagues.
        </p>
        <p>A healthy person would go to another country and catch some form of contagious illness or disease, he or she would then come back to their home country only to unknowingly spread the disease to hundreds and thousands of people.
        </p>
        <p>Things have completely changed in this day and age, however, as you have to take many measures before even stepping foot in another country. The passage of time has given people extensive knowledge and wealth which has led them to make numerous discoveries and inventions to take better take care of themselves and their fellow beings.
